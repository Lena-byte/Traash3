			<div class="Xartis"><img src="fotos/5.jpg" class="rounded" alt="..."></div>
			<div class="Rodopi"><img src="fotos/ροδοπη4.JPG" class="rounded" alt="..."></div>
		<p> In terms of geography, Xanthi belongs to the regional unit of Thrace. It borders Bulgaria in the north and the Thracian Sea in the south.  
			From the three prefectures of Thrace, Xanthi is the smallest in both size and population. The local terrain’s predominant natural feature 
			is the Rodopis mountain range, which houses pristine forests along with rich flora and fauna (the highest summit reaches an altitude of 1,827m).
			Three rivers, Nestos (in the west), Kosynthos (in the centre, which crosses the city of Xanthi), and Kompsatos (in the east) flow through 
			the prefecture of Xanthi, heading from north-Rodopi to south and irrigating the flourishing plain which consists of a wide range 
			of agricultural production (tobacco, cotton, grain, olives, vegetables and so on). </p>
			
			<div class="Limni"><img src="fotos/bistonida.JPG" class="rounded" alt="..."></div>
			<p>The river Kompasatos flows into Lake Vistonida, the sole lake in Thrace and the fourth in size in Greece. It is situated between 
				the prefectures of Xanthi and Rodopi and lies in the enclosure of Vistonikos Bay where terrestrial sedimentary rocks form 
				three narrow channels, which in turn allow passage to the sea. Variations in salinity are observed in the lake, and as a result, 
				its water is salty in the southern part but fresh in the northern one.  
			 <div class="flamingo"><img src="fotos/flamingoWiki.jpeg" class="rounded" alt="flamingo in Vistonida" title="Από Nchatzitou - Έργο αυτού που το ανεβάζει, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=49113984"></div>

			 The lake constitutes a wetland of great ecological value and hosts rich flora and fauna, such as reed beds, marshes, river meadows 
			 as well as numerous species of birds, amphibians, freshwater and seawater fish. However, the most unique species in the region are pink flamingos, 
			 which migrate to find themselves there every year seeking out the lake’s singularly favourable conditions.</p>

		<h4 class="heading text-center">A SHORT HISTORY OF ABDERA</h4>
		<div class="paralia"><img src="fotos/ΠΑΡΑΛΙΑ.jpg" class="rounded" alt="..."></div>
	
	
	<p> Abdera, one of the most important ancient cities in the North Aegean, lies in a favourable 
		location boasting two natural harbours on the coast of Thrace. It was founded by a group 
		of colonists led by Timesios from Clazomenae, a Greek city in the peninsula of Erythrae in Ionia, 
		in the mid-7th century.  <div class="poleis"><img src="fotos/ΜΗΤΡΟΠΟΛΕΙΣ.jpg" class="rounded" alt="..."></div>
		The colony did not thrive at first due not only to conflicts with the Thracians, who already dwelled there, 
		but also because of the adverse weather conditions at the estuary of the Nestos River, which used to 
		flow much closer to Abdera (nowadays there is a new riverbed). A striking feature from this time period 
		is that most graves in the area belonged to infants, which led to the conclusion that the first inhabitants 
		suffered from malaria, a fact also supported by skeletal remains.</p>

		<div class="Democritus"><img src="fotos/democritus.png" class="rounded" alt="..."></div>
		
	<p>Almost a century later, in 545 BC, the area was colonized for a second time by the inhabitants of Teos, 
		another Greek city situated very close to Clazomenae. The Teoans settled in the same territory and 
		coexisted with the Clazomeneans, claiming Heracles as mythical founder and Abdiros, as eponymous hero, 
		who according to legend had been devoured by the horses of King Diomedes of the Bistones Thracians. 
		In the beginning, those too faced various problems with the Thracians but they finally prevailed and 
		soon their city was flourishing, both on an economic and intellectual level. A plethora of distinguished 
		figures were born and lived in Abdera, such as Anacreon, the famous poet, Protagoras the sophist, and 
		the great philosopher Democritus, the father of atomic theory. </p>

		<div class="katopsi"><img src="fotos/BkNperivolos.jpg" class="rounded" alt="..."></div>
	<p>After the Persian Wars, Abdera joined the first Athenian Alliance, paying a particularly heavy 
		tax while maintaining close contacts with the independent Odrysian kingdom. In 376 BC, the city 
		was invaded by the Thracian tribe of the Triballi, while in around 350 BC it was seized by the 
		Macedonian king Philip II. Those events along with the geomorphological processes brought upon 
		about by the ongoing alluvial deposits of the Nestos River forced the Abderians to relocate further south. 
		A new urban complex was built under a comprehensive building programme which was designed according 
		to Hippodamian principles. It comprised strong fortification walls, an acropolis, two harbours and a theatre, 
		while dwellings were arranged around streets and squares.</p>
		
	<p>In the years of Roman domination in Greece, Abdera remained a free city-state but heavily reliant on and controlled by Rome. 
		The decline of the / this once powerful city of Thrace, which in its heyday had a population of around 22,000 inhabitants, 
		began at this very moment, not only because of political upheaval and instability but also due to the fact that alluvial 
		deposits caused by the Nestos River blocked its ports, upon which the power of the city had been based over the centuries.  
		Later, in the first half of the 4th century AD, the settlement, now significantly shrunk, was transferred to the hill 
		of the ancient acropolis, renamed Polystylon and a part of it was turned into a cemetery.  The area was  inhabited 
		up until the 14th century AD.
		</p>

		<div class="Economy"><img src="fotos/ABDERA,_Tetradrachm_473–448_BC 7.21.28 μμ.png" alt="..."></div>

	<p> Agriculture, animal husbandry, fishing, craftsmanship, artisanship but above all, extensive commerce activities 
		constituted the sources of private and public wealth. The city’s flourishing coinage, which began in around 520 BC 
		is indicative of its affluence. The city-state of Abdera was very well-organised; the type of government was democratic 
		with boule and demos (assembly) being its ruling political bodies. The chief archon and the archon eponymous was the 
		priest of Apollo or Prytaneis, while there were also other executive and financial archons ( Timouchoi, Nomophylakes, 
		Argyrotamies to name a few). Among the laws that had been passed we can mention the one which prohibited the burial 
		of those citizens who had squandered their father’s fortune on travel and the one which aimed at the protection 
		of democracy against conspirators.  </p>
		
	<p>The emblem of the city was a griffin and the protecting deity was Apollo. Other known cults were those of Dionysus, 
		Aphrodite, Athena, Hermes, Artemis, Demeter, Cybele, Heracles and of the eponymous archon, Abdiros.  
		Ancient written sources mention large religious festivals, like the Dionysia, Thesmophoria (in honour of Demeter) 
		and sport events in honour of Abdiros. The Dionysia consisted of sporting events, theatrical performances, and ceremonies 
		to welcome foreign officials and offer gold wreaths to those who had benefited the city.  </p>

		<p> Our knowledge surrounding the historical profile of the ancient city of Abdera is derived

		<p> Objects found in the city and the cemeteries of ancient Abdera are now displayed in the Abdera Archaeological Museum. 
			The exhibition covers a period from the 7TH century BC up to the 13th century AD. The presentation of the exhibits 
			is comprised of three main modules: public life, private life, and burial customs. These in turn are subdivided 
			into separate thematic groups. Finally, explanatory texts, relevant photographs, plans, and diagrams accompany the exhibits. </p>
